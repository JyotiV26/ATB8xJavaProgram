    /* Task2: OOPs and Features.
    OOPs -> Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
Feature ->
1. Encapsulation: Important information is contained within an object, with only some information being exposed.
2. Inheritance: Classes can reuse code and properties from other classes.
3. Polymorphism: Objects can take on more than one form, and share behaviors.
4. Abstraction: Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects
